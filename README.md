# 4-Bit Gray Code Counter

## Description
This project implements a 4-bit Gray Code counter using UVM.  
The counter cycles through the Gray Code sequence (0 to 15 in Gray Code) and includes a testbench for simulation and verification.

## Features
- 4-bit Gray Code counter RTL design
- Testbench for functional verification
- Simulation-ready design
- Reusable and modular implementation

## Files Included
- `rtl/` : RTL design files for the Gray Code counter
- `tb/` : Testbench files
- `sim/` : Simulation scripts or test cases (if any)

## How to Run
1. Compile the RTL and testbench files using your simulator (QuestaSim, VCS, etc.)
2. Run the simulation
3. Verify that the counter follows the correct Gray Code sequence
